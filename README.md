How It Works
1. org.com.util.EmployeeCsvReader

Reads employee.csv from src/main/resources.

Parses each row into an Employee object.

Handles null manager IDs.

2. org.com.service.EmployeeService

Core service for analysis.

Uses two maps internally for fast lookups:

employeeMap â†’ employee ID â†’ employee object

subordinatesMap â†’ manager ID â†’ list of direct reports

analyzeManagerSalaries()

For each manager, computes the average salary of direct reports.

Defines acceptable salary band (20â€“50% above average).

Prints whether the manager is:

UNDERPAID by X

OVERPAID by Y

Nothing if within band.

analyzeReportingLines()

Finds the CEO (the employee with managerId = null).

Traverses up each employeeâ€™s chain of managers until reaching the CEO.

If there are more than 4 managers in between â†’ flagged.

Reports exactly how many extra managers beyond the limit.

Detects possible circular references and warns.

3. org.com.Main

Entry point.

Loads employees from CSV, builds EmployeeService, and runs analyses.

Run with:
mvn clean package
java -cp target/employee-analyzer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.com.Main src/main/resources/employee.csv

Sample Output
Loaded employees: 25

--- Manager Salary Analysis ---
David White (ID: 5) -> UNDERPAID by 24200.00 (salary=25000.00, avg reports=41000.00)
Grace Hall (ID: 8) -> OVERPAID by 56500.00 (salary=100000.00, avg reports=29000.00)

--- Long Reporting Line Analysis ---
Nina Anderson (ID: 15) has a reporting line too long by 2 manager(s) [total managers=6]
Oscar Thomas (ID: 16) has a reporting line too long by 3 manager(s) [total managers=7]


ests

A JUnit test suite covers:

CEO detection (findCeoId)

Manager salary analysis (UNDERPAID/OVERPAID detection)

Reporting line depth calculation

Safety check for circular references

ðŸš€ Next Steps

Export analysis results to a CSV/Excel report (future enhancement).

Add integration tests with large datasets (1000+ employees).

Wrap into a REST API (Spring Boot) for interactive use.
